\section{Lesson 13}
\subsection{Memory Items}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Vector spaces are nonempty sets of vectors closed under formation of linear combinations.
    \item Vector spaces are affine sets containing the zero vector.
    \item Every vector space is a span, and every span is a vector space.
    \item Every vector space is a subspace, and every subspace is a vector space.
    \item The only linear combination of a linearly independent set of vectors equal to the zero vector is trivial.
    \item Representation in terms of a given basis is unique.
    \item The dimension of a vector space equals the number of vectors in a basis.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Other Remarks}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Orthonormal sets are linearly independent.
    \item Eigenvectors are linearly independent.
    \item Immediately linearly dependent if the set
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item contains $\textbf{0}$.
        \item contains more vectors than the number of rows.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item There are numerous basis vectors for every subspace.
\end{enumerate}
