\section{Lesson 11 (Informal)}
Informal memory items since none were officially provided.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Determinants only exist for square matrices.
    \item The determinant of a triangular (either upper or lower) is the product of the diagonal elements.
          \begin{enumerate}
              \item Thus, the determinant of a unitriangular (either upper or lower) is 1.
          \end{enumerate}
    \item Elementary row operations:
          \begin{enumerate}
              \item Exchanging two rows of a matrix reverses the sign of the determinant.
              \item Scaling a matrix by multiplication of one row by a factor $\alpha$ multiplies the determinant by $\alpha$.
              \item Subtracting a multiple of one row from another row leaves the determinant unchanged.
          \end{enumerate}
    \item Shortcut to finding determinants of large matrices: perform Gauss-Jordan and apply the above sub-bullets.
    \item A matrix is singular iff the determinant is 0.
    \item $|AB|=|A|\,|B|$
    \item $|A^T|=|A|$
    \item The determinant of a 2x2 matrix $A=[\begin{matrix}{\textbf a}_1 & {\bf a}_2\end{matrix}]$ is the area of the parallelogram generated by the columns of $A$ (i.e. the set of all linear combinations $\alpha_1{\textbf a}_1+\alpha_2{\textbf a}_2$ where $0\le\alpha_1\le1$ $0\le\alpha_2\le 1$).
    \item The sign of the determinant is called the \textbf{orientation} of the ordered set of vectors.
    \item $|U|=\pm{1}$ (for any orthogonal matrix $U$)
          \begin{enumerate}
              \item When $|U|=+1$, these matrices form the special orthogonal group $SO(n)$, which is closed under matrix multiplication.
          \end{enumerate}
    \item The set of permutation matrices with determinant 1 are the \textbf{even permutations}, and the set with determinant -1 are the \textbf{odd permutations}.
\end{enumerate}
