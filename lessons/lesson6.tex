\section{Lesson 6}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Every column of a matrix product is a linear combination of the columns of the first factor with coefficients from a column of the second factor.
    \item Every entry of a matrix product is the dot-like product of row of the first factor with a column of the second factor.
    \item Every matrix product is the sum of the products of the columns of the first factor with the corresponding rows of the second factor (outer product expansion).
    \item The Gram matrix contains all the relative geometric information regarding the columns of a matrix.
    \item $(A+B)^2 = A^2+AB+BA+B^2$
    \item Multiplying a matrix on the left by a diagonal matrix scales the rows of the matrix.
