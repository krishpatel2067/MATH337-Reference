\section{Lesson 19}

\subsection{Notes}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Matrix for Fib numbers. Diagonalization makes it easy to compute $A^n$.
    \item Diagonalizing this $2\times 2$: one e-val will always be 1, the other will always be less than 1.
    \item Both numbers in [an+1, an] will go to the same number in the limit of n to infinity since they're very close.
\end{enumerate}
