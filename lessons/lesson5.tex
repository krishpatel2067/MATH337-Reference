\section{Lesson 5}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The solution set of a linear system is empty if and only if the final column of the augmented matrix is a pivot column.
    \item The particular solution in the parametric vector form is distinguished from all other solutions by having all free components equal to zero.
    \item For linear systems with a nonempty solutions set, the number of basic solutions equals the number of columns of the coefficient matrix without pivots (nullity).
\end{enumerate}
