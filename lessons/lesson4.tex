\section{Lesson 4}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The Gauss-Jordan algorithm uses elimination to find the reduced row-echelon form of a matrix.
    \item The Gauss-Jordan algorithm has three major steps: the forward phase, normalization, and the backward phase.
    \item Elimination in the forward phase of Gauss-Jordan is generally where most of the computational effort is required.
    \item The reduced row-echelon form of a matrix is the unique reduced row-echelon matrix that is row equivalent to the matrix.
