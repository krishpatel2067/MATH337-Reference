\section{Lesson 10}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item A projection matrix is a matrix that is equal to its square ($P^2=P$).
    \item The null space of a projection matrix is the column space of it complementary projection.
    \item The fixed points of a projection equal its column space.
    \item A rank one matrix $A=\textbf{u}\textbf{v}^T$ is a projection iff (if and only if) $\textbf{u}\cdot\textbf{v}=1$.
    \item An orthogonal projection matrix with rank one has the form $\textbf{u}\textbf{u}^T$ where $||\textbf{u}||=1$.
