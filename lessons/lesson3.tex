\section{Lesson 3}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The elementary row operations transform a matrix into a matrix that is row equivalent to the original.
    \item Matrices that are row equivalent are also solution equivalent (but not necessarily vice versa).
    \item An elimination step uses a nonzero entry in a column to produce a row equivalent.
    \item Every elementary row operations can be reversed (undone) with an elementary row  operation.
\end{enumerate}
