\begin{enumerate}
    \item If a matrix is triangular, all its eigenvalues are on the main diagonal.
    \item A matrix is defective if it doesn't have as many free variables as the multiplicity of the eigenvalue. (Refer to \textbf{Example 16.6})
    \item Review the rational roots theorem: $\frac{\pm\,\text{factorsof leading term}}{\pm\,\text{factors of constant}}$
    \item TODO
\end{enumerate}
