\section{Lesson 8}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Every invertible matrix is the product of elementary matrices.
    \item Products of lower triangular matrices are lower triangular.
    \item Products of lower unitriangular matrices are unitriangular.
    \item LU is easily written down from the computation of the forward phase of Gauss-Jordan.
    \item CR is easily written down from the matrix and its reduced row-echelon form.
\end{enumerate}
